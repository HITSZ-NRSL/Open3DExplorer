# Semantic SLAM
***Author:*** Xuan Zhang, ***Supervisor:*** David Filliat

Research internship @ENSTA ParisTech

Semantic SLAM can generate a 3D voxel based semantic map using only a hand held RGB-D camera (e.g. Asus xtion) in real time. We use ORB_SLAM2 as SLAM backend, a CNN (PSPNet) to produce semantic prediction and fuse semantic information into a octomap. Note that our system can also be configured to generate rgb octomap without semantic information.

# Overview

![alt text](docs/images/overview.jpeg)

# Dependencies

- Openni2_launch

```sh
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-openni2-launch
```

- ORB_SLAM2

We use [ORB_SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) as SLAM backend. Please refer to the official repo for installation dependencies.

- PyTorch 0.4.0

- For other dependencies, please see [semantic_slam/package.xml](./semantic_slam/package.xml)

# Installation

### Build ORB_SLAM2

After installing dependencies for ORB_SLAM. You should first build the library.

```sh
cd ORB_SLAM2
./build.sh
```

### Make

```sh
cd <your_catkin_work_space>
catkin_make
```

### Install dependencies

```sh
rosdep install semantic_slam
```


# Run with camera

### Launch rgbd camera

```sh
roslaunch semantic_slam camera.launch
```

### Run ORB_SLAM2 node

```sh
roslaunch semantic_slam slam.launch
```

When the slam system has finished initialization, try to move the camera and check if the camera trajectory in the viewer is reasonable, reset SLAM if not.

### Run semantic_mapping

You can now run the semantic_cloud node and the octomap_generator node. You will have to provide trained models, see links below.

```sh
roslaunch semantic_slam semantic_mapping.launch
```

This will also launch rviz for visualization.

You can then move around the camera and construct semantic map. Make sure SLAM is not losing itself.

If you are constructing a semantic map, you can toggle the display color between semantic color and rgb color by running

```sh
rosservice call toggle_use_semantic_color
```
# Run with ros bag

If you want to test semantic mapping without a camera, you can also run a rosbag.

### Download rosbag with camera position (tracked by SLAM)

### Run semantic_mapping

```sh
roslaunch semantic_slam semantic_mapping.launch
```
### Play ROS bag

```sh
rosbag play demo.bag
```

# Trained models

# Run time

Evaluation is done on a computer with 6 Xeon 1.7 GHz CPU and one GeForce GTX Titan Z GPU. Input image size is 640Ã—480 recorded by a camera Asus Xtion Pro.

When our system works together, ORB-SLAM works at about 15 Hz (the setting is 30 Hz). Point cloud generation alone can run at 30 Hz. Semantic segmentation runs at about 2 to 3 Hz. Octomap insertion and visualization works at about 1 Hz. Please refer to section 3.6.2 of the project report for more analysis of run times.

# Configuration

You can change parameters for launch. Parameters are in `./semantic_slam/params` folder.

***Note that you can set octomap/tree_type and semantic_cloud/point_type to 0 to generate a map with rgb color without doing semantic segmantation.***
